    - To run only for measuring model performance run command 
        'python3 simpleRuleModel.py'    
    - To run for some particular city name, run command
        'streamlit run simpleRuleModel.py'

2. BPE based 
    - To run only for measuring model performance run command  
        'python3 bpeModel.py'    
    - To run for some particular city name, run command
        'streamlit run bpeModel.py'

** All the above command to be run from 'code' folder directory
